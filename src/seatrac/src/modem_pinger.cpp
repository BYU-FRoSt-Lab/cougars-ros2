/**
 * @brief Sends acoustic pings on a schedule
 * @author Clayton Smith
 * @date September 2024
 * 
 * Broadcasts acoustic pings over the seatrac x150 beacon on a timed 
 * schedule to avoid message overlaps in a fleet of UUVs. Signals are 
 * sent in a round-robin style, where each vehicle takes a turn sending a 
 * ping. The schedule is managed by the rasberry pi clock in each 
 * vehicle, so that it does not depend on every signal being receieved.
 * 
 * The ping schedule is based on 3 parameters: ping_delay_seconds, number_of_vehicles, 
 * and vehicle_order, and uses the following formula:
 * ping_cycle_length = ping_delay_seconds * number_of_vehicles
 * seconds_into_cycle = seconds_since_midnight % ping_cycle_length
 * time_until_ping = (ping_delay_seconds * vehicle_order - seconds_into_cycle) % ping_cycle_length
 * 
 * WARNING: raspberry pi clocks should be synchonized between
 * vehicles before using this node.
 * 
 * Publishes:
 * - modem_send (seatrac_interfaces/msg/ModemSend)

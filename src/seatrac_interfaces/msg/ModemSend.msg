# ModemSend is used to transmit an acoustic message to a remote beacon.

uint8 msg_id           # CID_E - Command Identification Code. Indicates the type of command to send to the beacon.
                       #    This ros message only supports the 4 commands relating to acoustic protocols:
                       #        CID_PING_SEND: Sends an acoustic signal without packet data and requires a response
                       #        CID_DAT_SEND: Sends a message with a data packet that can be one way or require a response
                       #        CID_ECHO_SEND: Requires a response and the response includes the same data packet
                       #        CID_NAV_SEND: Sends a message requesting a response with specific information from the other beacon

uint8 dest_id          # BID_E. Beacon id of the beacon to send the acoustic transmission to. (1-15 or 0 for all beacons)
uint8 msg_type         # AMSGTYPE_E. Specifies how the remote beacon should respond to the transmission. 
                       # Used with the PING, DAT, and ECHO protocols but not for the NAV protocol. 

uint8 packet_len       # optional packet length for data send commands (0 to 30)
uint8[30] packet_data  # optional packet data array for data send commands

uint8 nav_query_flags  # NAV_QUERY_T. Bit mask indicating which fields the NAV response should return.
                       # Used only with the NAV protocol
